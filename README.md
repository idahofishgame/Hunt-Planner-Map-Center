HuntPlanner MapCenter 4.0
============================

The IDFG HuntPlanner Map Center was given an overhaul 3/24/2017.  JavaScript, CSS, and HTML was updated to latest versions, most tools are now accessible via sidebar panel collapse instead of modals, the sidebar is completely expandable/collapsable.  This has all the great tools and functionality but has a clean new look.

The IDFG Map Center application is a tool for hunters to explore hunting opportunities in Idaho.

Functionality of this application includes:

- Toggle hunt-related and other data layers on/off in the map
- Change the map basemap to see Esri or Google topographic and imagery basemaps
- Query for and highlight hunt areas such as: game management units, elk zones, controlled hunt areas, waterfowl hunt areas, and/or game animal distributions.
- Download Google Earth KMLs of highlighted hunt areas
- Upload location data such as GPS tracks and waypoints
