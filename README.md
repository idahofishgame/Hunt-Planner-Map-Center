HuntPlanner MapCenter
============================

The IDFG Map Center application is a tool for hunters to explore hunting opportunities in Idaho.

Functionality of this application will include:

- Query for and highlight controlled hunt areas, Access Yes! properties, and/or Outfitter & Guide licensing areas and creating a KML (for Google Earth and GPS use) of the selected areas.
- Drag and drop a CSV of locations (ie. GPS lat, long coordinates) on to the application to display them on the map
- Toggle hunt-related and other data layers on/off in the map
- Place or coordinate search
- Make length and area measurements
- Draw on and add text to the map
- Create a PDF map of the current map view
